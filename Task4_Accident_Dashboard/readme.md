Road Accident Analytics Dashboard
This project is a Streamlit-based dashboard that visualizes road accident patterns using the UK Road Safety Accident dataset.​

Project Overview
Internship: Matrix Industries – Data Science Internship (Task 4)​

Goal: Present key insights, trends, and summary statistics for road accidents in an interactive dashboard.​

Tech stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Streamlit, Plotly Express, Seaborn, Matplotlib.​

The dashboard helps explore:

Total accidents, fatal accidents, vehicles/casualties involved.​

Accidents by severity, hour of day, day of week, and weather conditions.​

Road surface, lighting conditions, and speed limits.​

Monthly trends and basic dataset statistics (numeric summary, missing values).​

Dataset
Name: UK Road Safety: Traffic Accidents and Vehicles.​

Source: Kaggle (originally from UK Department for Transport open data).​

File used: Accident_Information.csv (accident-level data).​

Download the dataset from Kaggle and place Accident_Information.csv in the project root folder.​

Project Structure
Task4_Accident_Dashboard.py – main Streamlit app script.

Accident_Information.csv – accident dataset (not included in repository).​

requirements.txt – Python package dependencies.​

README.md – project documentation.

Setup and Installation
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended).​

Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Minimal requirements.txt:

text
pandas
numpy
streamlit
plotly
seaborn
matplotlib
Ensure Accident_Information.csv is in the same directory as Task4_Accident_Dashboard.py
