## Task 2: Data Visualization & EDA - Titanic Dataset

### Description
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Visualization to uncover insights from the Titanic dataset.

### Objectives
- Create multiple visualizations to understand survival patterns
- Analyze relationships between passenger characteristics and survival
- Generate actionable insights from data
- Visualize distributions and correlations

### Visualizations Generated

1. **Survival Status Distribution**  
   Overall count of survivors vs non-survivors

2. **Survival by Sex**  
   **Insight**: ✓ Women had significantly higher survival rates

3. **Survival by Passenger Class**  
   **Insight**: ✓ 1st class passengers survived at much higher rates

4. **Age Distribution**  
   Age distribution stratified by survival status

5. **Fare Distribution by Passenger Class**  
   **Insight**: ✓ Higher fares correlated with higher survival rates

6. **Fare vs Survival (Boxplot Analysis)**  
   Relationship between ticket fare and survival outcomes

7. **Port of Embarkation Analysis**  
   Survival rates by embarkation port (S, C, Q)

8. **Family Size Impact**  
   Effect of family members on survival rates

9. **Correlation Heatmap**  
   **Insight**: ✓ Correlation matrix of numeric features and survival probability

### Key Findings Summary
✓ Women Survival: Women had significantly higher survival rates  
✓ Class Effect: 1st class passengers survived at much higher rates  
✓ Fare Correlation: Higher fares correlated with higher survival  
✓ Age Factor: Younger passengers had slightly better survival rates
