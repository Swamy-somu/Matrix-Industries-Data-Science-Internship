Task 1 – Data Cleaning & Preprocessing 🧹📊
For Task 1, I worked on a Kaggle dataset and performed end-to-end data cleaning using Python (Pandas, NumPy).​
Handled missing values, removed duplicates, treated outliers, fixed inconsistencies, and exported a clean dataset ready for analysis.​

Task 2 – Visual Insights with Pandas/Matplotlib 📈🔍
In Task 2, I created visual insights on the Titanic dataset using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.​
Built charts like survival by gender/class, age and fare distributions, correlation heatmaps, and explained key patterns from the visuals.​

Task 3 – Simple ML Model with scikit-learn 🤖🎯
For Task 3, I used the Bank Marketing dataset to build a binary classification model in scikit-learn.​
Preprocessed features, applied one-hot encoding, trained a Logistic Regression model, and evaluated it with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix.​

Task 4 – Interactive Dashboard with Streamlit 🚗📊✨
In Task 4, I developed a Road Accident Analytics Dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly on the UK Road Safety accident dataset.​
The app includes filters, KPIs, trend lines, bar charts, pie charts, summary statistics, and a raw data explorer to interactively analyze accident patterns
